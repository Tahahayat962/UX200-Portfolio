                <p>
                    <a href=https://www.bscene.ca>Bscene</a> is a website with an accompanying newspaper that Jason manages,
                    and has visions for it to be a community hub for the Brant region. However, it was not getting the 
                    traction that Jason and Wiktor wanted. To solve this, we did user research, contextual inquiries, prototyping,
                    and usability testing to come up with our final, high-fidelity prototype. 
                </p>

                <p>My roles in this project were:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contributing in the user research, interviewing and doing contextual inquiries</li>
                        <li>Made a couple pages of the Figma prototype</li>
                        <li>Conducted usability testing</li>

                <h2>How we tackled the issue</h2>
                <h3>Initial research</h3>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we set out to interview 20 people in total. These were random people of varying demographics 
                    from Brant region. We asked them questions about Brantford in general, the culture surrounding it, BScene, 
                    and transportation. We also did contextual inquiries regarding the website and the newspaper, giving them 
                    tasks to do to find out how easy it was to use them.
                </p>
                <h3>The results</h3>
                <p>
                    The results we got were very mixed. There were a group of people that loved Brantford, and there were a group 
                    that absolutely hated it. According to our results, we made 2 personas: The local lover, and The local hater. 
                    The local lovers were usually of the older demographic, thinks Brantford is a nice place to be, attends events 
                    regularly, and has transportation. The local haters were of the younger demographics, thinks Brantford is boring, 
                    does not attend events, and does not have transportation. Most of our interviewees liked the website, but the newspaper 
                    ,not so much. The personas were used to shape our research from here on.
                </p>
                <h3>Developing a prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    We developed a prototype using Figma. The design thinking behind it was to make it intuitive, take the flaws of the 
                    old website, and create a new solution that both our personas could enjoy. Our design is more accessible, factoring 
                    in the fact that older people will be using the website. The prototype targets the event finding/discovery section 
                    specifically, because that was the issue that was presented. 
                </p>

                <h3>Usability testing</h3>
                <p>
                    Using our prototype, we conducted usability tests with 10 people, particularly of the older demographic. We asked them to 
                    do 2 tasks: To find a specific event, and to post an event. Through our research, we found that they mostly understood 
                    the layout, and thought it was an intuitive solution. 
                </p>
                <h3>The results</h3>
                <p>
                    The feedback we got were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The deep red color was a little too strong.</li>
                        <li>The safety measures for events could be shown.</li>
                        <li>There could be a notification feature.</li>
                        <li>It was a little too text-heavy, especially the event description.</li>
                        <li>It could use more filters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Based on our results, the next steps we could take are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have multiple color choices (light theme, dark theme) and text size choices.</li>
                        <li>Add a notification feature, and a feature to share to social media.</li>
                        <li>Make it less text-heavy and engaging to read through.</li>
                        <li>Have more filtering options.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>What I learnt</h2>
                <p>From this experience, I got to learn many things. It was my first time working with a client, and 
                    I learnt how to communicate with them, present information to them, and meet their needs. I also learnt 
                    how to use Figma further as this was my first time using the prototype feature of Figma.
